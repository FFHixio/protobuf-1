GopherJS bindings for [Improbable's gRPC-web implementation](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/)

These are still very early stage, but they've now been successfully tested against a go gRPC server.
See [my example repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/gopherjs-improbable-grpc-web-example) for an implementation.
