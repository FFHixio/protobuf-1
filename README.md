# GopherJS Bindings for Googles ProtobufJS
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/johanbrandhorst/jspb?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/johanbrandhorst/jspb)

This package is based on the node package `google-protobuf`.
It has been "compiled" with webpack.

## Usage
This package is not intended for use without the
[GopherJS protoc compiler plugin](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protoc-gen-gopherjs).
That package uses this package to interface with generated ProtobufJS files. See
the README of `protoc-gen-gopherjs` for usage.
